                      Netherlands or South Africa. There are two particular
                      reasons for this, one: its obvious, and two: because he’s
                      full of ‘Josh’. He’s got this lively energy that draws
                      people in, not forgetting his delightful humor, of course
                      (although, his laughter is more funnier than his joke).
                      And beyond his vibrant personality, Joshi is the kind of
                      person you'd want on your team, let it be a project, a
                      startup, a school election, or even a Model United
                      Nations. He's a natural leader who puts his all into every
                      endeavor, ensuring that the journey, if not the outcome,
                      is a resounding success.
